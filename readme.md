## Implementation

Because the 0.1 preview of Blazor only supports onclick and onchange events, I had to use onchange
for creating/editing items. That means that when creating a new task, it will be added when the text field
loses focus, even if you didn't hit Enter. Similarly, when editing a task, if you don't change anything 
you can't leave edit mode (Enter doesn't trigger onchange if there are no changes). 
These bugs can be fixed after upgrading to an as-yet-unreleased version of Blazor.

Access to localStorage is currently through javascript interop.
